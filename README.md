# CursesSnake

This is the repository for the CursesSnake game. A very simple snake made in C++ and curses library.
If you wish to build it yourself from the source you'll need ncurses on linux and PDCurses on windows.
CMake is provided for the linux build. As for windows you can alter the CMake or simply use Visual Studio.

Binaries for both windows and linux are in the Releases.
